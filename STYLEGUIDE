***************************************************************************/

This document is meant to be a general coding styleguide for development on
YAM. It carries information on how to structure and layout the source code
during development. All registered developers of YAM should at least have
read once through this guide and stick to the particular rules and
suggestions on how to structure particular code passages. That way future
developers may more easily find a way into the complex source code of YAM
and take it as a reference on how to find out the YAM developers expect
their source code to look like.

So please, any YAM developer, try to stick to the rules listed in this guide
as much as possible so that the code will stay readable even if more than
one developer is working on a certain section.

############################################################################

1. Indentation - Tabulator use (TAB)
------------------------------------

In the past we had too much trouble with excessive tabulator use in the
source code of YAM. Therefore, any use of tabulator characters (0x09) to
structure the source code should be considered FORBIDDEN. Instead, we agree
that for indentation of source code we use TWO (2) spaces (0x20) instead:

Example:

   win = OpenWindowTags(NULL,
                        WA_Title,       "Test",
                        WA_InnerWidth,  width,
                        WA_InnerHeight, height,
                        TAG_DONE);

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - 24 (12x2) spaces / *NO* tabs

############################################################################

2. Blocks
---------

Blocks start on a new line, with the same indentation as the previous line,
and end likewise. Example:

  for(i=0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    ...code...
  }

The braces can be omitted for one-line blocks. E.g.

  for(i=0; i < 10; i++)
    array[i] += 30;

One exception from this rule is the do-while. These should be formatted like
this:

  do
  {
    ...code...
  }
  while(a < 10);

############################################################################

3. if/then
----------

Normal block rules apply. However, if both branches of an if-else statement
are one line blocks, then they should be formatted like this:

  if(a < 20)
    Foo();
  else
    Bar();

If-then-else-if should be merged like this:

  if(a < 20)
  {
    ...code...
  }
  else if(a < 40)
  {
    ...code...
  }

All blocks in a merged if-then-else-if sequence should share the same style
when it comes to have their braces or not, where the latter is then only
possible when all branches are one line blocks.

############################################################################

4. Tuples
---------

A tuple is one parenthesis immediately followed by first member. If more
members are present, they should be separated with ", ". Example:

  (unsigned long first, unsigned long second, unsigned long last)
                       ^                     ^
                       +---------------------+- note the spaces here !

############################################################################

5. Functions
------------

Functions are always proper case, meaning the first letter is a capital
letter. If the function name is made up of several words, they should
also start with a capital letter.

There is one space after the return type, unless this is a pointer
(marked by an asterisk), then the space is between the type and the
asterisk. There is NO space between the function name and the opening
pharatesis

There is exactly one blank line between functions.

Sample functions:

  int AllocateBuffer(unsigned long size)
  {
    ...code...
  }

or

  char *AllocateArray(unsigned long size)
  {
    ...code...
  }

############################################################################

6. return
---------

A function should only have AN exit point at the end of that function.
An exception to this rule is resource allocation or similar sanity checks
placed at the beginning of the function (at outermost scope). Here one can
immediately return a failure. Example:

  BOOL IsLegal(char *str)
  {
    if(str == NULL)
      return FALSE;

    ...code...

    return res;
  }

The rule says »...*AN* exit point at the end« rather than *one*. This allows
to make a function with several exit points all placed at the end, like this:

  BOOL IsWhitespace(char *character)
  {
    if(character == ' ' || ...)
      return TRUE;
    else
      return FALSE;
  }

Just for the record: return is a flow-control-directive similar to case,
break, continue and goto, and therefore the value provided should not be
enclosed between parenthesis.

############################################################################

7. No "goto" statements
-----------------------

Because general goto usage tend to obfuscate source code and end up in
"spaghetti code" goto statements/use YAM should generally be avoided. Even
if that ends up in more deep if() arrangements, we believe it is a better
practise to restructure your source code instead of being lazy and entering
a goto statments together with a label.

############################################################################

8. No "typedef" statements
--------------------------

As a general "typedef" usage tends to obfuscate source code and make it
unreadable for the highly trained developer, we believe we should avoid
using typedef's at all. There are plenty of other ways to achieve the very
same (espcially with enums). So please consider NOT using any own typedef
statements in your code and keep on using the native types.

############################################################################

9. Use "enum" types wherever possible
-------------------------------------

Instead of using a plain "int" type variable, enumeration types (enum)
should be preferred. Even for local status variables enums should be
preferred over plain "int" status variables. So, by no means you should use
an integer to keep the status of a certain operation.

So, DON'T do something like:

  BOOL IsRed(int color)
  {
    if(color == 0)
      return TRUE;
  }
    
A proper version of the same function would be:

  BOOL IsRed(enum Color color)
  {
    if(color == CL_Red)
      return TRUE;
  }
  
In addition you should also use enum types in function definitions and don't
simply define them as an "int" variables.

So, DON'T do something like:

  BOOL IsRed(int color)
  {
    if(color == CL_Red)
      return TRUE;
  }

But use "enum Color color" as shown in the second example above. By using
enum types in your functions you make it more easy for a developer to
understand and track the meaning of the variable. In addition, by using
enum types in functions you will allow the compiler to warn you in case
you may have forgotten to catch a use case (e.g. in switch statements).

############################################################################

10. switch/case
---------------

A switch case looks like this:

  switch(value)
  {
    case ONE:
    {
      ...code...
    }
    break;

    case TWO:
    {
      ...code...
    }
    // continue

    default:
    {
      ...code...
    }
    break;
  }

If a case needs to fall through to the next one, then a comment should be
put instead of the break, as in the example above. The text within this
comment is situation-specific, but generally 'continue' will do.

The case follows normal block rules, but extends the rule about braces
being optional for one-line blocks.

Whenever possible, a switch-case should use symbolic names rather than
numbers. This also applies to state-machines implemented through
if-then-else-if, even if there are only two states.

If a set of cases exists with only one command, then one can write a
block of compact cases. The colons and semi-colons should be aligned
with one space after each and one space in front of each on the longest
line. It is allowed to have a compact block of cases within a normal
switch/case sequence. Example:

  switch(value)
  {
    case ONE:   number = "one";   break;
    case TWO:   number = "two";   break;
    case THREE: number = "three"; break;
    case FOUR:  number = "four";  break;
    case FIVE:  number = "five";  break;

    case FOURTYTWO:
    {
      ...code...
    }
    break;
  }

############################################################################

11. Variables
-------------

Variables should generally have as meaningful names as possible. Avoid
custom abbreviations but do use common ones (like scr, win, obj etc.).
Do not use negating words like 'no' in a boolean value but try instead
to use something like 'is', as in "isUppercase". This applies both to
boolean values and functions which return a boolean.

Local variables and function arguments are either completely lowercase or
camelon notation, where the first letter is lowercase and the first
letter of the following words is uppercase, as shown in the previous
example.

Defines (both constants and macros) are completely uppercase. However, if
the defines are such as like "#define isUppercase" then a mixed case
writing is allowed.

Multiple variable definitions on a single line should be avoided and better
be expanded to multiple lines for better readability.

Example:

  struct CustomEntry
  {
    char *Name;
    char *Address;
  };

rather than

  struct CustomEntry
  {
    char *Name, *Address;
  };

Enumerations, global variables and structure names and members are proper
case as defined under "Functions". Generally static variables should also
comply with this rule (when they are really meant as global, but local not
to clutter the global namespace).

As we want to introduce multithreading to YAM sooner or later please avoid
using static Variables. Instead of that use our "struct Global" which can
be easily locked by sempahores. 

Abbreviations which normally appear in uppercase (e.g. HTML) should still
be uppercase despite the above rules.

Some examples:

  #define ABS(x) ((x) < 0 ? -(x) : (x))
  #define PI     3.14159265358979323846

  Object *GlobalConfig = DataspaceObject, ..., End;

  struct CustomEntry *CreateEntry(char *name, char *address)
  {
    struct CustomEntry *res;

    if((res = malloc(sizeof(struct CustomEntry)))
    {
      res->Name = name;
      res->Address = address;
    }

    return res;
  }

############################################################################

12. Use "const" on variables whereever possible
-----------------------------------------------

By using "const" on variable definitions you give the compiler an additional
hint on the usage of these variables. For modern compilers, this allows to
tune the optimization and not only make faster code but also provides
a more secure environment. While this will allow the compiler to warn you
(as the developer) on cases where you might have accidently accessed the
variable in write mode, it will also allow the compiler to move the data
section of that variable into the read-only part of the executable and thus
make it secure for external modifications.

Therefore, whereever possible you should use "const" on variables from which
you know will never change their content.

So, instead of doing something like:

  BOOL IsRed(enum Color color)
  {
    if(color == CL_Red)
      return TRUE;
  }
 
You should define the function like:

  BOOL IsRed(const enum Color color)
  {
    if(color == CL_Red)
      return TRUE;
  }
 
This will allow the compiler to warn you in case you are trying to
do some local modifications to the "color" variable.

############################################################################

13. Custom Class naming
-----------------------

Since we manage our own MUI custom classes in the 'src/classes' directory
of YAM, we try to make things clear as much as possible. One thing is the
naming of the YAM internal custom classes.

We have the convention that internal MUI classes of YAM should be put into
the 'classes' subdirectory and together with the file naming, the internal
class should use the same 'camelon notation' like we use for variables.

Example: "TextEditor" instead of "Texteditor".

In addition, we believe the class/file-name itself should clearly show from
which superclass a particular class was inheriented. For example, if you
generate a new class which is inheriented from MUIC_Group, we highly suggest
to use a name ending with "Group".

Example: "ReadMailGroup" instead of "ReadMailClass"

############################################################################

14. Types
---------

We mostly use standard C-types wherever possible. This is 'char *' for
STRPTR, 'char' for TEXT, 'void' for VOID and 'void *' for APTR. However,
for certain Amiga specific tasks we stick to the special Amiga types. For
Example, for defining MUI objects we use "Object *" rather than 'void *',
but also rather than APTR.

Further, although YAM is currently ANSI-C, one should always use proper
types, so that we may later compile the project with a C++ compiler.
This means that if you e.g. have an IntuiMessage pointer that must be
supplied to 'ReplyMsg()', you should use the format
'ReplyMsg(&imsg->ExecMessage)'.

For strings embedded in structures, pass a pointer to first character,
as this also serves as extra information for the person who reads the
source. For example,

  struct Person
  {
    char Address[SIZE_ADDRESS];
    char RealName[SIZE_REALNAME];
  };

  ...

  struct Person *pe = SomePerson();
  printf("Letter came from %s\n", &pe->Address[0]);

as opposed to:

  printf("Letter came from %s\n", pe);

############################################################################

15. Taglists
------------

When providing taglists, one can either put all tags on the same line
(if only a few tags are supplied), or put one tag on each line, which
is then indented with as many spaces until the opening pharatesis of the
taglist function. When putting one tag on its own line, the first line that
contain the 'receiver' should NOT contain a tag.

The comma should come immediately after the tag ID, and at least one
space should follow. More spaces are allowed for padding (but no tabs -
see rule about Tabs, which btw also contains a taglist example). For
example:

  SetAttrs(obj,
           MUIA_Window_LeftEdge,   left,
           MUIA_Window_TopEdge,    top,
           MUIA_Window_Width,      _width(msg->other),
           TAG_DONE);

^^^^^^^^^^^ - 11 spaces - NO tabs

############################################################################

16. ANSI-C vs. AmigaOS
----------------------

As a general rule: Use the ANSI-C functions like memcpy, malloc etc.

The exception is when the Amiga versions handle locale specific things
which the ANSI-C functions lack. As of this writing, only ToUpper,
ToLower, Stricmp and Strnicmp are cases where the Amiga versions should
be used. The same applies to variable types as mentioned in section 9 of
this styleguide.

############################################################################

17. Comments
------------

A general rule for commenting is: Comment as much as possible while you
are developing your algorithms!

For comment style, we highly prefer using the C++ single line commenting
variant. Even for multiples lines we prefer to use the C++ style (//)
comment characters as we than can more easily comment out things temporarly
with the "/* ... */" comments. So please use the "//" C++ style comments
wherever possible.

############################################################################

18. Debugging statements
------------------------

As we recently implemented a very flexible runtime debugging functions in
YAM, all developers are adviced to make use of the provided debugging macros
as much as possible! Especially for the function entry and exit positions
the special macros 'ENTER()', 'LEAVE()' and 'RETURN()' should be considered
mandatory for every new function introduced in YAM.

Example:

  BOOL Function(char *text)
  {
    BOOL result = FALSE;
    ENTER();

    ... code ...

    RETURN(result);
    return result;
  }

Another mandatory/important debugging macro is the so-called 'ASSERT()'.
It allows to check for a certain condition and if that conditition isn't true
anymore, it will immediately output an error string and exit the application.
It should be used whenever possible and where ultimative conditions should
be checked.

Example:

  BOOL Function(char *text)
  {
    BOOL result = FALSE;
    ENTER();

    ASSERT(text != NULL);

    text[10] = 'h'; // if text == NULL a crash would occur!

    ... code ...

    RETURN(result);
    return result;
  }

In addition, the macros like 'SHOWVALUE()' and 'SHOWSTRING()' also can come
handy during debugging a certain situation. So please check the "debug.h" file
in the 'src' directory of YAM. It contains all currently supported debugging
macros including the printf-like macros "D()", "W()" and "E()" for outputting
variable texts for debugging, warning or even error conditions.

Please note that in case YAM will be compiled without the "DEBUG" define, all
code normally emitted by these macros will be omitted. They are really plainly
meant to be usefull during debugging.

############################################################################

19. Obsolete string functions
-----------------------------

A simple rules is: In any event, try to avoid to use one of the following
functions as they are known to cause buffer overflows or other known issues.
Use their replacement functions listed here instead:

  OBSOLETE    REPLACEMENT
  --------    -----------
  strcpy      strlcpy
  strncpy     strlcpy
  strcat      strlcat
  strncat     strlcat
  stccpy      strlcpy
  sprintf     snprintf
  vsprintf    vsnprintf
  strtok      strpbrk

So please try to avoid the use of one of the above listed functions as their
use should be really considered obsolete within YAM. And if we try to stick
to their much safer variants listed here, we really hope to be a bit more
on the safe side and highly reduce the probablity of unwanted crashes due to
buffer overflows.

############################################################################

20. Avoid the use of MUIA_ShowMe
--------------------------------

It is known, that the use of MUIA_ShowMe may cause trouble with older MUI
versions (<= 3.8) but also may screw up the window layout with newer MUI
versions, under certain conditions. See bug #1716466 at http://bugs.yam.ch/
for more info on a common MUIA_ShowMe issue.

Whereas we don't want to generally ban the use of MUIA_ShowMe
in the sources of YAM, we highly suggest to try to avoid it. Whereever
easily possible, a MUIA_ShowMe use should be replaced by the corresponding
MUIM_Group_InitChange/ExitChange combo so that an object will be dynamically
removed (hided) and added (shown) by using there Group method calls instead

############################################################################

21. Do NOT use GetAttr() or SetAttrs()
---------------------------------------

A common mistake when programming BOOPSI classes is to either forget to
properly terminate a SetAttrs() call or that a GetAttr() call might end up
in an uninitialized variables. Both of these problems should, however, be
solved by using the more convienent and secure xget() and xset() macros.

These macros will make sure that the GetAttr() and SetAttrs() calls are
properly terminated and that a GetAttr() call will always return 0 in
case an attribute isn't available.

So to be on the safe side, the direct use of GetAttrs() or SetAttrs()
should be considered obsolete and all calls should be replaced by their
equivalent xget/xset calls.

############################################################################

22. Prefer AllocSysObject(), AllocDosObject() like functions
------------------------------------------------------------

As with newer operating system versions certain new functionality regarding
resource tracking has been added (especially AmigaOS4), the use of the
AllocSysObject() and AllocDosObject() functions should be considered the
preferred way to allocate system resources.

That means, e.g. instead of doing things like CreateIORequest() you are
requested to use AllocSysObject() to create an IORequest. The same applies
for all kind of system structures where these structures are normally
allocated via AllocVec(). For such structures you are adviced to use the
corresponding AllocXXXXObject() functions if they exist and do the same
job!

############################################################################

23. Use forward declarations - keep the header files (*.h) clean!
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To keep the header files - and especially the way '#include' statements are
performed - clean, the use of forward declarations should considered
mandatory. To clear things up, the following rules should apply:

  - If a variable in a header file (*.h) is to be defined as a pointer and
    its type is a custom type (e.g. struct), then a forward declaration
    of that type should be put at the top of the header file rather than
    including the header where this type is defined.

  - No forward declarations for 'enum' types should be defined. While some
    compilers might support it, it is not part of any standard.

  - put your forward declarations at the top of each header file, right
    after the last #include statement. They should always look like:

    --- cut here ---
    #include <intuition/classusr.h> // Object

    // forward declarations
    struct Mail;
    --- cut here ---

    whereas "struct Mail" is the forward declaration.

The main reason why we prefer the use of forward declarations rather than
including every necessary header file is, because it keeps the header files
clean and reduces the possibility of circular include statements. Even more
important, it keeps the dependency list (which is generated via 'make
depend') clean and speed up compilation as well.

############################################################################

24. Comment your structure elements
-----------------------------------

When implementing a new structure via "struct XXXX" it always helps if the
individual structure elements are commented at the point where the structure
will be defined. This should also be done if the element name itself might
be self-explanatory. In practice, this means instead of doing something
like:

  struct Person
  {
    char firstname[10];
    char lastname[10];
    time_t birthday;
  };

you SHOULD do something like:

  struct Person
  {
    char firstname[10];  // the first name of the person
    char lastname[10];   // the last name (surname) of the person
    time_t birthday;     // the birthday in days from 1.1.1970
  };

By adding line comments (//) to each structure element you help developers
to understand what the individual elements stands for. In addition, you can
give additional information about implications or warnings.

############################################################################
