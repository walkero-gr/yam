YAM (short for **Y**et **A**nother **M**ailer) is a MIME-compliant open-source mail user agent (MUA) written for Amiga-based computer
systems (AmigaOS4, AmigaOS3, MorphOS, AROS). It supports POP3, SMTP, TLSv1/SSLv3 connection security, multiple users, multiple identities
, PGPv2/v5 encryption, unlimited hierarchical folders, filters, a configurable user interface based on the Magic User Interface (MUI)
framework and an ARexx interface and many other features which are common for MUAs today.

## Features

As the development of YAM goes back to 1995 it is one of the most feature-rich applications on the Amiga platform. Especially
the MUI-based user interface allowed to implement functionality which are commonly used in graphical mail user client on other platforms today. Furthermore, the focus on support and compliance to recent RFCs is one of the key goals of YAM.

* Straightforward installation and configuration, taking only a few minutes to set everything up.
* Runs "Out-of-the-Box" without any installation or Assign required for expert users.
* Easy operation using toolbar buttons, menus, keyboard and drag&drop functionality.
* Basic e-mail functions: Read, Write, Reply, Forward and Bounce mail
* Six standard folders: Incoming, Draft, Outgoing, Sent, Trash and Spam.
* Any number of user-definable folders, which can be compressed and/or encrypted via own passwords set.
* Hierarchical ordering of folders.
* Multiuser support. Optionally, address books and other configuration files can be shared.
* Searchable address book supporting groups and distribution lists.
* Full POP3 support allowing to check/download mails on startup, on demand or at regular time intervals.
* Configure an unlimited amount of POP3 accounts.
* Message download pre-selection: browse message headers and select only those mails you want to download.
* Write or Reply to your mails off-line and send them to the mail server using the built in SMTP support
* Extract sender information from message headers and create an address book entry with just a simple mouse click.
